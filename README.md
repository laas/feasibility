Experimental project to learn a feasibility function, which directly relates two
points in configuration space

Sub-projects:
 -- Read in a .tris file, consisting of triangles, and display it in RVIZ + doing
 collision checking with FCL
 -- Random walk sampling of feasible positions between two objects
 -- log time for distance checking, depending on distance between objects


The usual path to a fresh build:

$mkdir build
$cd build
$cmake ..
$make
